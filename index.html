                    Hello there, welcome to my webpage. My name is Alejandro but I do more commonly go by Alex. I am a novice coder looking
                to expand my knowledge on the subject. Anything along the lines of coding and programming has always fascinated me and I am glad
                to be learning how it all works.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">
                    I currently live in Alpharetta, Georgia. I am employed with the grocery store Publix as a "Customer Service Staff." I mainly handle accounting 
                and supervise the other associates. But I also help with all of the other tasks around the store.
                </p>

                        As for hobbies, I am an avid pc gamer whom likes competitive and challenging titles. When it comes to
                    most things in my life I like more challenging than easier activities to keep me engaged. Anything short of that usually bores me. Other than
                    that I am just your common introvert who can spend the entire day in front of a computer screen. Browsing, searching, and navigating the 
                    interwebs one click at a time!
